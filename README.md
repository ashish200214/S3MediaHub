# S3MediaHub

A simple and powerful web application that allows users to upload images and videos through a modern HTML form.  
The uploaded files are:

1. Stored securely in **Amazon S3**
2. Recorded in an **AWS RDS (MySQL) database** with full metadata
3. Previewed directly on the frontend before upload

This project is built using **PHP**, **AWS SDK for PHP**, **S3**, and **RDS**.
